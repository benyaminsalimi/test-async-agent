# test-async-agent

An adaptable, professional README scaffold for your project. This repository currently contains version-control metadata only; update the sections below as code is added to keep the documentation accurate and helpful.

> Tip: Replace placeholders with concrete details (tech stack, commands, architecture) once your implementation is in place.

## Features

- Clear, skimmable sections for fast onboarding
- Copy-ready install and usage commands for common stacks
- Contribution guidelines designed for smooth collaboration
- License section with guidance to formalize usage rights

## Installation

Follow the steps that match your stack. If you haven’t chosen a stack yet, you can start by cloning the repo and setting up a virtual environment or Node project.

1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

2) Set up your environment (choose one)

- Node.js (npm):
  ```bash
  # Requires Node.js >= 18 and npm >= 9
  npm install
  ```

- Node.js (pnpm):
  ```bash
  # Requires pnpm >= 8
  pnpm install
  ```

- Python:
  ```bash
  # Optional but recommended
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
  # Replace requirements file/path as needed
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Docker:
  ```bash
  # Ensure Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is running
  docker build -t <your-image-name> .
  ```

## Usage

Replace the commands below with the actual entry points for your project.

- Node.js:
  ```bash
  # Start development server
  npm run dev

  # Run production build
  npm run build && npm start
  ```

- Python:
  ```bash
  # Run your application (adjust module/script name)
  python -m your_package

  # or
  python path/to/your_script.py
  ```

- Docker:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 <your-image-name>
  # or with Compose
  docker compose up --build
  ```

### Examples

```bash
# Example: run tests
npm test                     # Node
pytest -q                    # Python

# Example: lint and format
npm run lint && npm run fmt  # Node
ruff check . && ruff format  # Python (if using ruff)
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To propose changes:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/concise-branch-name
   ```
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits.
3. Add or update tests when applicable.
4. Run linting/formatting and ensure CI (if configured) is green.
5. Open a pull request with a clear title and description:
   - What changed and why

### Commit message convention (suggested)

Use Conventional Commits for clarity and automation:

- `feat: ...` for new features
- `fix: ...` for bug fixes
- `docs: ...` for documentation-only changes
- `refactor: ...` for code refactoring without behavior change
- `test: ...` for adding or updating tests
- `chore: ...` for tooling, build, or maintenance tasks
